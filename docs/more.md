## FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
FFI, or **Foreign Function Interface**, is a mechanism that allows a program written in one programming language to call functions or use services written in another language. It serves as a bridge between languages, enabling interoperability between them. FFIs are essential when you want to use libraries, tools, or APIs written in a different language than the one you are working in.

For example, you might write a performance-critical module in C for use in a Python application, or you might want to call a Rust library from a JavaScript application.

## ABI (Application Binary Interface)
ABI, or **Application Binary Interface**, defines how different components of binary code interact at a lower level.
